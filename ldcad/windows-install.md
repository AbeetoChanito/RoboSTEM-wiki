## Downloading LDCad

### [Click Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UqMcGwUKQ5Js3pzRujdtpYwMX2jGSoXG/view?usp=sharing)

Click on the link, and download the zip file. Once downloaded, extract the zip to wherever you prefer. Once the files are done extracting, open the folder, and create a shortcut for “LDCadVEX.exe”. Then drag the shortcut to your desktop for easy access. Open LDCadVEX. It should ask you to select a main LDraw folder. Select the “Library” folder that is in the same folder as LDCadVEX. You should see a blue interface, and a menu with VEX parts on the left. (See Image)
