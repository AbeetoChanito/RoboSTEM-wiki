# LD CAD

LD CAD is a CAD (Computer Aided Design) software that allows us to design robots on our computer and see if new ideas will work before committing to building a robot with real parts.

## Why use CAD to design robots?

CAD lets us design new ideas and mechanisms without the need for having parts at home or needing parts that you don't have that are being ordered. It also lets us design robots in places that we normally could not, such as airplanes or in the bus. This lets us try new ideas more easily and fix problems with the robots we designed.

## What platforms does LD CAD support?

Although LD CAD is only officially supported on Windows, we will also go over how to install LD CAD on macOS too.

## What hardware specs do I need to run LD CAD?

All you need to run LD CAD is a mac OS or windows computer with around 100mb (For windows) or \~5GB for Mac/Apple, although a mouse is recommended to make it easier.
