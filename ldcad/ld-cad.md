# LD CAD

### LD CAD

LD CAD is a cad (Computer Aided Design) software that allows us to design robots on our computer and see if new ideas will work before committing to building a robot with real parts.

<summary>Why use CAD to design robots?</summary>

CAD or computer aided design lets us design new ideas and mechanisms without the need for having parts at home or needing parts that you don't have that are being ordered. It also lets us design robots in places that we normally could not, such as airplanes or in the bus. This lets us try new ideas more easily and fix problems with the robots we designed.
