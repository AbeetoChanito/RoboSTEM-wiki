# Mission Statement

RoboSTEM aims to inspire and prepare students for the future by providing accessible resources in robotics, engineering, and STEM.

> "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

## What are we doing to achieve this goal?

With this wiki, we aim to centralize VEX IQ knowledge that often remains inaccessible to many. By making this project open-source, anyone can contribute to this wiki at any time. We are committed to creating an inclusive VEX IQ community, and we believe that this wiki will get us one step closer.
