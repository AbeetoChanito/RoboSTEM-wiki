# Arcade Drive

### Arcade Drive

Arcade drive is a style of stick mapping. The concept of it is making 1 stick's horizontal axis spin the robot in place. While another stick's vertical axis controls the robots movement backward and forward. &#x20;

This is the standard configuration for arcade drive. It uses the D Axis of the controller (Right Horizontal) to control robot rotation. And the A axis to control forward and reverse. But this is not the only way to do arcade drive.

Here are 2 examples of other ways to do split arcade. We have reversed, where the left stick controls turn and the right controls forward and backward movement and 1 stick mode where all the controls are in 1 stick without using the other stick. This allows the other stick to be used for other things such as controlling other motors.
