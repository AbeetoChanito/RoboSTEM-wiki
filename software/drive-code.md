# Drive Code

There are 2 different types of drive stick mappings: [Tank Drive](tank-drive.md) and [Arcade Drive](arcade-drive.md).

In order to understand these 2 different stick mappings, we first have to understand the stick axes on the VEX IQ Gen 2 controller.

The VEX IQ Gen 2 controller has 2 joysticks, which each have their own horizontal and vertical axes.

| Stick       | Horizontal | Vertical |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Left Stick  | B          | A        |
| Right Stick | C          | D        |

Keep this in mind when we code our drivetrain.

## Do I use arcade control or tank control?
Ultimately, this comes down to driver preference. Your driver should try out both modes of control and see which one works out for them best. Signature events and world championships have been won in pretty much every method of control listed here, so one method of control isn't necessarily better than another.
