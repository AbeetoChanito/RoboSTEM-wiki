The vex IQ gen 2 controller has 2 joysticks. They each have 2 axis's with horizontal and vertical axis's.&#x20;

| Stick       | Horizontal | Vertical |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Left Stick  | B          | A        |
| Right Stick | C          | D        |

Keep this in mind as we will have to use this to code our drive.
